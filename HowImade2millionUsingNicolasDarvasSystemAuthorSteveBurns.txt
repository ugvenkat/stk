How I Made Money Using the Nicolas Darvas System, Which Made Him $2000000 in the Stock - Steve Burns

Traders or friends don't give stock tips because they'd also need to explain stop losses, position size, the right time to buy, and when to sell. Without all this information, any tip you get isn't valuable.

amateurs sold stocks when they reached new highs, experienced investors bought them, and sometimes those stocks doubled in value.

You want to buy stocks in growing industries where people expect high earnings. Focus on stocks that have been rising and just hit new highs. Ideally, everyone holding the stock is making a profit, with no one waiting to break even. Don't worry about diversifying; choose a few stocks you like, hold onto the ones that keep rising, and sell those that don't.

You can grow your account using the Darvas Box System by buying stocks during market uptrends and switching to cash during downtrends.

Sell your stocks and switch to cash if the S&P 500 falls below its 200-day moving average.

A recession is expected due to rising unemployment and a declining stock market. A key sign is when the market fails to reach new highs. Staying invested in a consistently falling market is not profitable. Buying during a market crash is a sure way to lose money and sleep.

It's surprising to learn that buying a stock when it's already at a high, aiming to sell it even higher, is often less risky than buying it as it falls to a new low, hoping it will bounce back to previous highs.
Save your bargain-hunting for the grocery store. When you're trading stocks, focus on buying the strongest stock in the strongest sector when it makes a new high from a well-established pattern. This approach mirrors how the most successful traders have historically operated.

When everyone is voting for a stock to go up, it's wise to join them by buying that stock. At that point, the odds are in your favor because it's unlikely the stock will suddenly reverse course.

Buying into a stock that's consistently dropping to lower lows is very risky. When everyone is betting against it, buying in goes against the majority and can lead to unnecessary losses. A falling stock can plummet further when fear grips the market, and trying to buy in early on a rebound is often a mistake known as a "dead cat bounce." It's smarter to follow the market's direction—swimming against it is risky and dangerous.

Thank goodness, now I can sell this stock at the price I bought it for." The stock faces heavy selling pressure as it climbs back up. That's why buying stocks at their highest prices is crucial.

The Darvas method involves focusing on stocks that steadily trend upwards within defined price ranges (boxes) until they break out. Once a stock breaks out of its box, it typically continues trending without returning to previous levels. Darvas advises watching only three or four successful stocks at a time to avoid spreading attention too thin. Price boxes should be established over at least three weeks. Buy when a breakout occurs; avoid chasing stocks that have quickly risen through a box and are making new highs again, as they often face resistance. If you must buy, do so near the bottom of the new price box established after the breakout.
Although the Darvas method may seem risky due to its focus on a few high-growth stocks and buying during uptrends, risk is managed by entering high-probability situations and cutting losses quickly when wrong. The gains from successful trades typically outweigh losses from unsuccessful ones. Success hinges on timing purchases, minimizing losses, and monitoring the price movements of the strongest stocks in the market.

Darvas explains that in his box system, it's safe to buy at support levels as long as the stock remains above the established price box.

Remember: Always buy when the stock is strong and sell when it's weak. Volatile markets that move sharply up and down without clear trends can be risky. Trade only in markets that are clearly trending if you want to follow Darvas's approach.

I could have easily thought that paying $61, the all-time high, was too much. But if I had, I would have missed out on another $41 increase, bringing the price up to $102.25.

In bull markets, the strongest stocks continue to rise without encountering resistance to higher prices. In bear markets, most stocks lack solid support at lower prices.

If you can't find stocks at all-time highs or at least 52-week highs, you're likely in a bear market. In this situation, it might be more effective to consider shorting stocks that are at their all-time lows or 52-week lows instead.

On January 4, CNBC reported significant withdrawals of money from mutual funds and stocks into safer investments. That day, I chose to follow the crowd and liquidate all my accounts.

Please, never believe anyone who says it's impossible to time the market. There are business cycles, and stocks experience ups and downs. During recessions and depressions, stocks can plummet. Educate yourself: buy when stocks are trending up and sell when they're trending down. If there's a crash like the bursting of the Internet bubble, a terrorist attack on the U.S., or a collapse in the real estate market—be cautious and move your investments into cash.

Undisciplined traders usually lose most of their capital by taking too manage large risks.

But the key is to buy it the moment it breaks out; do not chase it if you miss this breakout

if a stock started rising sharply with high trading volume and broke through new price levels, Darvas had no issue joining other buyers, even if he didn't understand the reason behind its surge. He relied on the stock's price and trading volume to guide his decisions. Instead of trying to predict the market, he followed what the market was showing him. Stocks that were reaching new highs with increased trading activity signaled a buy. Conversely, if a stock faltered and fell back into a previous price range, it indicated to him that market interest was waning, prompting him to sell.

When you discover a product that has the potential to revolutionize an industry, change someone's life, or impact the world, you may have found a stock that aligns with Darvas's principles.

In strong bull markets, you rarely get another opportunity when high-performing stocks break out before earnings.

Swing trading can generate profits most of the time, but using the Darvas method during a bullish market can lead to substantial wealth. When actual money is on the line, people often avoid accepting a loss, hoping the stock will recover instead. Avoid this mistake: Always cut your losses.
